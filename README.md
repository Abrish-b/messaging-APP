# Introduction

## The Project
Video Messenger App is a new type of social networking application. It will allow you to have face-to-face conversations with people all around the world in an easy way. Users will be able to get in touch with somebody from a different country by just one click. This app can be really really helpful because it will allow people that are far away to chat and see each other through video chat or text chat. Video Messenger App is perfect for people who want to keep up with someone in another city, or even country, without doing the whole long distance relationships thing.

VideoMessenger App is a website that provides a functionality of send messages and call to connected users. It's a clone of messaging apps to show case the inne workings of Messaging App and how zoom and other platforms perform Video calls.

## The Context

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Holberton School. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.


## The Team
it's a solo band for this one since i wanted to challenge myself to persist a pressure of creating a project from a scratch alone

## Blog posts
After the development phase, I wrote a blog post to reflect on the Video Messenger App journey and to explain more about the inner workings.
